# Embedded Sensor Monitor

## Description
This project demonstrates a basic embedded system application written in C.  
It simulates reading data from a sensor and processing the data in a simple application.

## Features
- Modular C code structure
- Simulated sensor data reading
- Clear separation between logic and hardware

## Technologies
- C
- Embedded system fundamentals
- Git & GitHub

## Future Improvements
- Interface with real sensors
- Add RTOS-based task scheduling
- UART communication
